# GBMahili-Chrome-Extension

This is an extension that was done with simple line of code while following a tutorial by Brad Traversy on YouTube.

## PURPOSE

Ever wanted to have all your favorite links in one single place, just a click away?
This is a Google Chrome Extension that does that, expect, only for me. 
But anyone can customize it and use their links instead.

## LANGUAGES USED:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
